# Catch-all Marketing is not Working for Voters

If you send out un-customized marketing materials for everybody, you will just waste your resource and even end up losing your votes.

## What is this project about?
Every election season, we enocunter so many so-called ["Voter Guides"](https://progressivevotersguide.com/washington/2021/general?type=general&year=2021&src=pvg2019general&lang=en). These guides are sent from "umbrella" kind of political organizations. They are packaging their recommendations for every single race and ballot. Is this broad messaging working? What if voters have diverging opinions on seemingly similar progressive issues?  
For example, in 2019, there were Initiative #976 (whether to cut transportation funding) and Referendum Measure No. 88 (restoring Affirmative action or not), in WA state.

 This voter guide recommended "No" for Initiative #976 (so don't cut) and "Approed" for Referendum #88 (so restore Affirmative action). However, if a voter has a different set of opinion (maybe "No" for #976 but "Disapproved" for #88), the voter would distrust this guide as a whole.

 This mapping project is to spot election precincts that have this kind of divergence. After spotting these precincts, marketers and organizers will be able to employ more tailored marketing strategies for them.
